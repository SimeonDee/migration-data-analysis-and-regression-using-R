# walmart-sales-analysis-and-regression-using-R
This project uses Migration Dataset from World Development Indicators database to demonstrate Hypothesis Testing, Sales Analysis, Time-Series Analysis and Linear Regression Model using R-Programming Language.

## Tools Used
---
- R-Language (for Hypothsis Testing, Analysis, Time-Series Analysis and Regression Modeling)
- Microsoft Power BI (For Dashboard and Reporting)

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various metrics ranging from economic, Financial (Lending interest rate, ), Basic amenities and assessibilities, educational, medical and environmental estimates of data of five countries namely USA, Canada, Germany, UK, India, Mexico, China, Australia, Bangladesh and Pakistan. 

18 different metrics were measured covering data from 2012 to 2021:
1. **GDP per capita (current US$):** is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
   
3. **Children out of school (% of primary school age):**
5. **Population density (people per sq. km of land area):**
6. **Access to electricity, rural (% of rural population):**
7. **Inflation, consumer prices (annual %):**
8. **Lending interest rate (%):**
9. **Tuberculosis case detection rate (%, all forms):**
10. **Life expectancy at birth, total (years):**
11. **Prevalence of severe food insecurity in the population (%):**
12. **Population, male:**
13. **Population, female:**
14. **Population, total:**
15. **:**Population growth (annual %):**
16. **Age dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population):**
17. **Individuals using the Internet (% of population):**
18. **Poverty gap at $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) (%):**
19. **Share of youth not in education, employment or training, total (% of youth population):**
20. **Mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes or CRD between exact ages 30 and 70 (%):**

## Investigation
I Analyzed the dataset to find out how these metrics affects migration (immigration or emmigration) for the countries under study
**Tool used:** R-Programming

## Insight Visualization and Reporting
I used PowerBI to create a Dashboard showing the various KPI's as it affects Migration for these countries.

**Tool used:** Microsoft Power BI



The dataset came from across various sources such as World Bank,  across various
The project analysis
